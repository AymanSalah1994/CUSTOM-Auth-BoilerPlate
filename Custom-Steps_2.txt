1-First include the Auth URLS and Accounts urls  inside your Main urls.py file inside your Config App 
//path('accounts/', include('accounts.urls')), 
>> Don't Forget to Create urls.py file for this app
//path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),

2-Now if you Visit any Sub-URL for "http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/"  The Site Actually work , Although you MIGHT get an Error Because For example for "log in " We MUST Create Template for it inside a Folder called registration --> "registration/login.html"
PLUS we didn't Specify what View to Respond to this Url Above ?
 

3-Configure the Templates Folder inside your settings.py file 
// DIRS = [str(BASE_DIR.joinpath('templates'))]

4-Now Create a 'templates' Folder . && Inside it Create "registration" folder too 


5-In this registration Folder you Will put the templates files, Make Sure names are correct so that Django will detect them Automatically . 
Some of those files are below :
{log.html ,   password_reset_done.html  ,  password_change_done.html  ....ETC } Remeber for those templates you MUST stick with certain Named So that the Auth app Can Detect them  .
// You Can Also create Signup.html Template , But you Can call this anything Since We are Not waiting for something to Detect it ! 


6-If you Visit the Urls after Creating Template you will find Nothing , because your templates are empty , In general Keep in mind that , for login for example the LoginView will send A form Object Right ?
So in your login.html file Put this form Object  to be shown ,, password_change will include some kind of form for changing password So we need to put the form object also and SO ON ...ETC
{{ form.as_p }} <<Writing Only this inside logn.html is Enough to show the Form on the browser ! 


7-Now Just a Couple of Environment Variable that you Need to put in your settings.py file 
    -LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home' # home is a Name of a View for redirect
    -LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'home' # home is a Name of a View for redirect



Q / Sign-up ?
A /DO this : 
    1-Inside urls.py in this app [Actually you Will Create this urls.py file], define a path for '/signup'
    2-Define the SignUp View [ Form , Template and Success URL ]
        1-success_url
        2-the form_class 
        3-template_name for this View
